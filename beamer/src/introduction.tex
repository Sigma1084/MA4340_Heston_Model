	\begin{block}{Stochastic Differental Equation}
		An SDE is a differential equation that contains a stochastic term
		\[ dX_t = \mu(X_t, t)dt + \sigma(X_t, t)dW_t \]
		where \( \mu \) is called the \textbf{drift term} and
		\( \sigma \) is called the \textbf{diffusion term}.

	\subsection{Ito-Doeblin Formula}
	\begin{theorem}[Ito Doeblin Formula] \label{thm:ito-doeblin-formula}
		Let \( f(t, X) \) be a continuous function in time \( t \) and \( X \)
		where \( X \) is a Random Variable that is continuous in \( t \).
		Then, the Ito Doeblin Formula is given by
		\[ df(t, X) = \left( f_t + \frac{1}{2}f_{XX} \right) dt + f_{X} dX \]
