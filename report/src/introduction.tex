\subsection{Background}
    In 1973, Black and Scholes studied and obtained the famous
    Blackâ€“Scholes (B-S) pricing formula and established the classical
    parametric option pricing model.
    The B-S formula can lead all investors to a risk-neutral world with
    risk-free interest rate as the rate of return, and it can predict
    the price of options better, regardless of their preferences.

    However, the formula has made many assumptions in advance,
    for example, the volatility and interest rate of options are assumed
    to be a constant;
    the underlying asset follow geometric Brownian motion, etc.,
    is not completely consistent with the actual market situation;
    thus, the option price calculated by the formula is far from the
    real world situation.


\subsection{Topic of Interest}
    Many Researchers proposed improved models to obtain option price
    values more closer to actual values, two of such models are
    \textbf{Heston} model, which uses stochastic volatility to overcome
    the constraints of constant volatility and \textbf{CIR} model,
    which uses stochastic interest rate to overcome the constraints of
    constant interest rate in B-S model.


\subsection{Aim of the Project}
    The aim of this project is to study Heston, stochastic volatility model
    and CIR, stochastic interest rate model, and implement them on real
    world data.
